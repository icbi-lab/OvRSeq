#' Random Forest Classifier for BRCAness
#'
#' A trained random forest classifier for predicting BRCAness status using a
#' 24-gene expression signature. This classifier was trained with multiomics
#' data from the TCGA-OV dataset and utilizes RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data to
#' classify patients as either having BRCAness or BRCA status.

#'
#' @description
#' This data object contains a trained random forest classifier that utilizes a
#' 24-gene expression signature to classify patients into two categories: those
#' with BRCAness and those with BRCA status. The classifier was trained using
#' multiomics data, including RNA-Seq data, from the TCGA-OV dataset.
#'
#' @details
#' The random forest classifier in this data object was trained with feature
#' selection to optimize its ability to predict BRCAness status based on RNA-Seq
#' data. It is a result of a multiomics approach aimed at accurately classifying

#' BRCAness Gene Signature
#'
#' A gene signature developed through feature selection to optimally classify
#' TCGA-OV samples into BRCAness and non-BRCAness categories. The signature
#' consists of gene expression values (2TPM+1 normalized) for 24 genes. These
#' genes were selected based on their importance in three different machine
#' learning models (Random Forest, Ada Boost, and Gradient Boosting) after
#' recursive feature elimination. Only genes that were among the top 50 most
#' important features in at least two of the three models were included in
#' this signature.

#' @format
#' A vector containing the gene symbol for 24 genes.

#' @description
#' The BRCAness gene signature is a result of an extensive feature selection

#' based on gene expression data from the TCGA-OV dataset.

#' Immune Signatures
#'
#' A GMT (Gene Matrix Transposed) file containing well-defined immune-related

#' processes, including T cell inflammation, IFN gamma signature, cytolytic
#' activity, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte function.

#' Small Immune Signatures
#'
#' A GMT (Gene Matrix Transposed) file containing concise immune-related
#' gene signatures. Each signature is limited to fewer than 10 genes, which

#' precise z-score calculations for immune-related processes as opposed to
#' single-sample gene set enrichment variances.
#'
#' Each signature within the file facilitates the characterization of
#' specific immune-related activities, such as T cell inflammation, interferon-gamma
#' response, cytolytic activity, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, and various
#' components of the immune system. Splitting larger signatures into smaller,
#' more manageable sets can yield a clearer understanding of the biological
#' data by focusing on the most relevant and influential genes.

#' Tumor Infiltration Status Classifier
#'
#' A Random Forest classifier trained on gene expression data from the ICON7 trial.
#' This classifier is designed to classify the tumor immune infiltration status
#' into categories such as 'infiltrated', 'excluded', or 'desert' based on a
#' gene signature. The model is trained using `randomForest` package and can be
#' used to predict the infiltration status of ovarian cancer samples.
#'
#' @format An object of class `randomForest` (inherits from `list`), representing
#'   a fitted Random Forest model.
#'
#' @details
#' The classifier was trained using a Random Forest algorithm with 300 trees
#' on the ICON7 dataset, which contains gene expression data for ovarian cancer
#' samples. The gene signature used for the training consists of genes identified
#' as common between the SummarizedExperiment datasets and the tumor immune phenotype
#' signature.
#'
#' The `classifier_infiltration_status` is saved as an R object of class `randomForest`,
#' which contains the entire fitted model object. This model can be used to predict
#' infiltration status in other datasets by supplying the appropriate gene expression
#' data for the genes included in the signature.
#'
#' The classifier should be applied only to data that has been preprocessed in the same
#' manner as the ICON7 trial data to ensure the validity of the predictions.
