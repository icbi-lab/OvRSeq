\title{BRCAness Gene Signature}
\format{
A vector containing the gene symbol for 24 genes.
}
\usage{
data(brcaness_signature)
}
\description{
The BRCAness gene signature is a result of an extensive feature selection
process using machine learning models. It represents a subset of genes that
are critical for discriminating between BRCAness and non-BRCAness samples
based on gene expression data from the TCGA-OV dataset.
}
\details{
A gene signature developed through feature selection to optimally classify
TCGA-OV samples into BRCAness and non-BRCAness categories. The signature
consists of gene expression values (2TPM+1 normalized) for 24 genes. These
genes were selected based on their importance in three different machine
learning models (Random Forest, Ada Boost, and Gradient Boosting) after
recursive feature elimination. Only genes that were among the top 50 most
important features in at least two of the three models were included in
this signature.
