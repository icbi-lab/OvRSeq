\title{Build SummarizedExperiment Object for OvrSeq}
\usage{
OvaRSeqDataSet(count_data_df, col_data_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_data_df}{A data frame containing count data (log2-transformed TPM or similar).
The rows should represent genes, and columns should represent samples, with row names set as gene names.}

\item{col_data_df}{A data frame containing column metadata.
Each row should correspond to a sample, and columns should represent sample attributes. Row names should be set as sample IDs.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with the count data and column metadata integrated.
}
\description{
This function creates a SummarizedExperiment object for OvrSeq analysis by combining count data and column metadata.
}
\details{
The function ensures that only samples present in both count data and column metadata are used to construct the SummarizedExperiment object. It checks for the presence of necessary row names in both data frames and then performs the intersection. The count data is transposed to match the format expected by the SummarizedExperiment constructor.

\examples{
# Assuming count_data and col_data are pre-loaded data frames
se <- build_OvrSeq_SE(count_data, col_data)
