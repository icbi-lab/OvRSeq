\title{Small Immune Signatures}
\format{
A list of lists, where each sublist contains:
  - `Name`: The name of the immune signature.
  - `Genes`: A character vector of gene symbols, each representing fewer than
    10 signature genes for focused analysis.
}
\usage{
data(small_immune_signatures)
}
\description{
The `small_immune_signatures` object contains well-curated, small immune-related
gene signatures in GMT format, suitable for refined gene expression analysis.
These small signatures are derived from larger gene sets, trimmed for optimal
focus and precision in immune process characterization.
}
\details{
A GMT (Gene Matrix Transposed) file containing concise immune-related
gene signatures. Each signature is limited to fewer than 10 genes, which
is why they are termed "small." These limited gene sets can provide more
precise z-score calculations for immune-related processes as opposed to
single-sample gene set enrichment variances.

Each signature within the file facilitates the characterization of
specific immune-related activities, such as T cell inflammation, interferon-gamma
response, cytolytic activity, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, and various
components of the immune system. Splitting larger signatures into smaller,
more manageable sets can yield a clearer understanding of the biological
data by focusing on the most relevant and influential genes.

in immune signature analysis, as well as general GMT file structure and gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA), refer to the relevant literature and software documentation.
