\title{TCGA-OV RNA-Seq Dataset}
\format{
A SummarizedExperiment object.
}
\usage{
data(TCGA_OV)
}
\description{
This dataset contains raw RNA-Seq counts from the TCGA-OV dataset. It includes
 metadata columns that provide additional information about the samples,
 including patient age, tumor grade, clinical stage, tumor residual disease
 status, and BRCAness classification.

\details{
A SummarizedExperiment object containing raw RNA-Seq counts from the TCGA-OV dataset,
along with metadata columns including AGE, TUMOR_GRADE, CLINICAL_STAGE,
TUMOR_RESIDUAL_DISEASE, and BRCAness.


The TCGA-OV dataset is stored as a SummarizedExperiment object, which provides
an organized and efficient structure for working with high-throughput genomics data.
The metadata columns allow for the exploration of clinical and molecular attributes
associated with the samples.
